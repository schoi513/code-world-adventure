# [Youtube Tycoon] Proposal

## What is [Youtube Tycoon]?

Youtube Tycoon is web based onclick button event game that is based on javascript.
I am makng this game because I used to stream part time during my college and personally even though I
was passionate about it but I never acted upon it so I wanted to at least make it on javascript project! 
Also lots of free games that gets popular on mobile apps like based on onclicks and easy going to keep the time pass by.

## Initial thoughts on game structure

I want to base on onlicks events and images attached to the buttons or random set of images pop up to make it realistic feel. 
I also want to have big number of set random text box per button so when clicking a button will give out what random events were happens and show how that interacted with cash/fagtigue/number of followers/time.
The problems that I expect to encounter are;
the completeness and difficulty of the project. 
how I can make complete random interactive buttons and its chain of events to make the user have fun.


## Phases of Completion

1. write all the pseudo codes on css, html, javascript
2. make all the javascript code work, mainly on text messages and onlick event function
3. add images to the buttons and create random set of text boxes
4. putting it all together.
5. possible peer review to see what can be improved upon
6. improve the game
7. present
